<h1 style="background-color:#ad947a;">Meet the shiner surfperch</h1>

<h1>Cymatogaster aggregata</h1>
<h2>Animal Behavior</h2>
The most abundant surfperch along the California coast, shiner surfperch live in loose schools in sloughs and bays and around pilings.
Shiner surfperch can live in both salty ocean water and the fresher water in coastal wetlands.
<h2>Diet</h2>
Small crustaceans, arrow worms, amphipods, fish eggs
<h2>Appearance</h2>
A male shiner surfperch changes color with the seasons. Come summer, he covers his shiny silver and yellow stripes with a darker suit of courtship colors.
<h1 style="background-color:#774010;">Meet the bay pipefish</h1>
<img src="https://www.montereybayaquarium.org/globalassets/mba/images/animals/fishes/rw15-034.jpg?format=webp&quality=70" height=330 width=490>
<h1>Syngnathus leptorhynchus</h1>
<h2>Animal Behavior</h2>
A female pipefish courts the male. If the courting is successful, she deposits up to 721 eggs in a brood pouch on the underside of the male’s body.
Then a protective tissue forms over the pouch opening and seals the eggs inside.
The male incubates the eggs and even supplies nourishment to the embryos via an attachment to his abdominal wall and bloodstream.
The eggs hatch in about six weeks depending on water temperature.
A pipefish has tiny dorsal and pectoral fins that beat rapidly as it leisurely swims — either vertically or (mostly) horizontally.
A pipefish steers by moving its head from side to side.
<h2>Diet</h2>
Small crustaceans
<h2>Appearance</h2>
At first glance, you might not notice a bay pipefish gliding through the eelgrass — its long, pencil-slim body and greenish color mimic a swaying blade.
In place of scales, jointed, bonelike rings encircle this fish’s body. To eat, a hungry pipefish gets its tubular, toothless mouth an inch or so from its prey — and slurps.
