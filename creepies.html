<h1 style="background-color:darkslateblue;">Meet the white sturgeon</h1>
<img src="https://www.montereybayaquarium.org/globalassets/mba/images/animals/fishes/white-sturgeon-rw17-172.jpg?format=webp&quality=70" height=330 width=490>
<h1>Acipenser transmontanus</h1>
<h2>Animal Behavior</h2>
Mostly a bottom-dweller, a white sturgeon spends its time rummaging on the seafloor for food. Unlike most other fishes, its taste buds are on the outside of its mouth.
These taste buds, along with barbels (feelers) under the sturgeon's snout, help the fish select food, and a toothless mouth sucks it up.
<h2>Diet</h2>
Shrimp, clams, crabs, worms, mussels, snails, small bony fishes
<h2>Appearance</h2>
Formerly up to 20 feet (6.1 m) and 1,800 pounds (816 kg); today the largest white sturgeon grow to 10 feet (3 m) and 400 pounds (181 kg)
The white sturgeon is like no other fish! Instead of scales, five rows of bony plates (scutes) reach from its gills to its tail, covering its sandpaperlike skin.
It also has sharklike qualities, including a cartilaginous skeleton and a sharklike tail.
<h1 style="background-color:darkmagenta;">Meet the Pacific spiny dogfish</h1>

<h1>Squalus suckleyi</h1>
<h2>Animal Behavior</h2>
Despite their small size, spiny dogfish are aggressive and have a reputation of relentlessly pursuing their prey.
The name "dogfish" stems from their habit of feeding in packs — sometimes numbering in the hundreds or thousands.
Gathered together, they sweep an area, eating the fishes in front of them. They'll eat almost anything they can get their strong jaws and teeth on.
Newborn dogfish will even attack fishes two to three times their size.
<h2>Diet</h2>
Squid, fishes, crabs, shrimp and other invertebrates
<h2>Appearance</h2>
All sharks have unique skin. It's covered with toothlike scales called denticles — unique to sharks and very similar to the teeth of all vertebrates —
which make the skin rough and abrasive. In fact, shark skin was once dried and then used as sandpaper to polish wood. Today, shark skin is still cured and, after the denticles are removed,
used as leather.
As their name suggests, spiny dogfish sharks sport sharp, venomous (poisonous) spines in front of each dorsal fin.
Their bodies are dark gray above and white below, often with white spotting on the sides.
