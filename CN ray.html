<h1>Cow Nosed Ray</h1>
<h2>Animals Behavior</h2>
Rays move by undulating their bodies up and down like a wave, or by flapping their pectoral fins like wings. These fins are often referred to as “wings.”
When resting, rays lie buried in the substrate, often with only their eyes showing. This can be to the detriment of swimmers or divers who inadvertently step on them.
Stepping on the spine or getting stabbed with that spine is immediately quite painful. It is suggested that swimmers, walking on the bottom, shuffle their feet.
The rays will swoosh out of the way.
Rays often visit the “cleaning stations” of the Bluehead Wrasse (Thalassoma bifasciatum) and the Spanish Hogfish (Bodianus rufus),
fish that clean excess mucous from the skin and eat parasites
from the skin and gills. Fish visiting these cleaning stations will affect a pose, with the mouth and gill covers open,
much like the Galapagos Tortoise (Geochelone elephantopus)
does for the Galapa-gos Finches (Geospiza species).
The cleaners swim in and out, picking parasites and food particles.
<h2>Diet</h2>
Wild – Mollusks, crustaceans and small fishes.
Zoo – Fresh-frozen chopped fish and shrimp.
<h2>Appearance</h2>
The entire ray group – as well as sharks – demonstrates the camouflage called counter-shading.
The back is some shade of dark to match the ocean floor, when viewed from above, and the belly
is light or white to be bright against the brightness at the water’s surface, when viewed from below.
Many, many marine and fresh-water animals demonstrate counter-shading, including orcas, penguins and trout.
All of the ray group are quite dorso-ventrally flat and have their mouths on the ventral side.
Being cartilaginous fish, there are no bones at all, the skeleton is completely cartilage.
Most rays do not have teeth, as sharks do, but rather have a “bony” plate, top and bottom, with strong jaws.
Rays have one or more envenom-mating stingers on their tails. Ray species vary from 10 inches to over 6 feet in width.

<h1>Southern Stingray</h1>
<h2>Animal Behavior</h2>
The southern stingray visits “cleaning stations” where bluehead wrasses and Spanish hogfish eat parasites and mucus from the stingray’s body.
Atlantic stingrays can be found in singles, pairs and sometimes in large aggregations.
If you travel to stingray habitats, like the Cayman Islands, remember to shuffle your feet through the sand when you're wading — this shy animal will simply swim out of the way.
Never try to touch or harass a stingray or other ocean animals. By being respectful of the stingray’s life and home, you'll help protect populations for the future.
<h2>Diet</h2>
Feeds opportunistically, but prefers bivalves, worms, shrimp, crabs and small fishes
<h2>Appearance</h2>
The southern stingray has a large, flat, diamond-shaped disk without a distinct head.
Its olive-brown to greenish-grey upper body and white underbelly is ideal camouflage for an animal that spends its days well buried in sand.
From above, only its eyes and huge spiracles (respiratory openings that are often mistaken for eyes) are visible.
