<h1>Clown Fish</h1>
<h2>Animal behavior</h2>
In the wild, a clownfish needs the protection it finds in an anemone. The anemone’s stings keep fish predators at bay, and a clownfish never lives without its host anemone.
The partnership may benefit the anemone as well — it gets scraps of food dropped by the clownfish as it eats.
And the aggressive and territorial clownfish may defend its anemone by driving away butterflyfishes and other anemone-eating fishes.
<h2>Diet</h2>
Tiny drifting animals like copepods and zooplankton; algae
<h2>Appearance</h2>
All clownfish start life as a male. As it grows, a male may change to become a female.

<h1>Square-Spot</h1>
<h2>Animal Behavior</h2>
By day, these brilliantly colored fish gather in small groups just above the edges of steep reef slopes.
Here, strong currents provide a steady supply of the tiny, drifting animal plankton on which they feed.
By night, or when larger predators threaten, squarespots seek shelter among the nooks and crannies of the reef.
<h2>Diet</h2>
Tiny drifting animals
<h2>Appearance</h2>
Only males sport the bright, square spots on their sides that give this fish its common name. Squarespots are most common at depths of around 100 feet (30 m) or more.
There in the dim light their spots seem to glow, warning rival males and catching the eye of females.
All squarespots start life as females. As they grow, some change into males.

<h1>The Parrot Fish</h1>
<h2>Animal Behavior</h2>
A parrotfish swims by rowing itself along with its pectoral (side) fins. Wrasses share this swimming style.
The next time you visit our Kelp Forest exhibit, watch how the sheepheads and señoritas swim — they're both members of the wrasse family.
Parrotfishes produce tons of coral reef sand each year — as much as one ton of sand per acre of reef.
The sand-making process begins as a  fish grazes on the algal film that grows on coral rock.
To feed on the algae, the fish munches on pieces of coral. Molarlike teeth in its throat grinds the coral, which then travels through its digestive system and is deposited in the reef as
white coral sand.
<h2>Diet</h2>
Algae that covers coral and the reef bottom
<h2>Appearance</h2>
Generally brightly colored, about 80 species of parrotfishes swim in coral reefs around the world. They have fused teeth that form beaklike plates, giving them a parrotlike appearance.
They have large thick scales that, in some species, are strong enough to stop a spear.
