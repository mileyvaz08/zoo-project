<h1>Panthera Lion</h1>
<h2>Animals Behavior</h2>
Hunting may take place day or night. The lion pride is highly organized and, like most cats, they head-butt in greeting. The pride consists of 4-12 related adult females,
their offspring and 1- 6 adult males. The pride may break into in groups called “companionships” within the pride’s home range.
These sub-prides function independently but may come together for cooperative hunts.
Males do hunt, but their primary duty is to protect the pride and its territory from interloping rival males.
Bigger and slower adult males seldom join female hunts. Females and sub-adult cubs do most of the cooperative hunting.
When food is scarce, males eat first, then females then cubs. As many as ¾ of non-nursing cubs die of starvation before they reach 2 years of age.
Because they hunt cooperatively, lions kill more healthy prey than other carnivores.
The fact that lions band together is a very unusual behavior for cats. Although sibling groups of other cat species will do so, lions are the only cats that regularly hunt cooperatively.
The basic reason behind such behavior goes to the kind and size of animals they prey upon.
Despite the cat-equipment, so perfect for dealing with prey half the size of the predator, prey as big, bigger than, or significantly bigger than the predator calls for more … more claws,
more teeth, more cats.
Lions often act the scavenger rather than the hunter, and their favorite source of someone else’s kill is hyenas.
Spotted Hyena (Crocuta crocuta), long thought to be premier scavengers, have proven to be very efficient hunters.
Hyenas and lions go back and forth with the you-steal-from-us and the we-steal-from-you activities.
Which group, pride or pack, is successful at the vanquish-and-steal depends upon which group is larger at the time.
Researchers have documented on-going rivalries between lions and hyenas occupying the same territory. Another favorite target for theft is cheetahs.
<h2>Diet</h2>
Wild – Most Lion prey weighs 110-1100 lbs. Lions are opportunistic feeders (as are most predators)
and are known to take rodents, hares, birds, reptiles and large insects, as well as their usual large antelope or zebra prey.
Zoo – Prepared Feline Diet with fasting one day a week. Knuckle bones on fast days.
<h2>Appearance</h2>
Lions are tawny to yellow-cream, often with individual hairs darker at the tip. The abdomen and insides of legs are cream to white.
The backs of the ears are dark brown to black, with no white ‘follow-me’ spots. The male’s mane is tawny to reddish-brown or black, with variations based on family lines as well as region.
The coat of immature animals has a pattern of light brown rosettes that fades as they mature, although vestiges may remain on the lower abdomen and legs of adults. Lion eyes are a golden brown.
The tawny coat can tend towards light (nearly white) or dark, and fully black melanistic lions (as in black leopards (Panthera pardis) or black jaguars (Panthera onca)) have been seen.
These animals, much like the white tigers, seldom live long past independence from their mother, if they leave the pride, because the odd coloration may not be accepted by others
and it may also make it difficult for them to camouflage when hunting.
